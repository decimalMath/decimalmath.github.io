# Levenshtein Distance for Name Generation

## Introduction

As the blockchain ecosystem continues to grow, the ability to humanize interactions and data for users is becoming increasingly important. One significant challenge is the translation of complex hexadecimal blockchain addresses into readable, unique names. This not only makes interactions more intuitive for users but also aids in the easy identification of addresses. However, this name generation process isn't as straightforward as it seems, with several hurdles to overcome, such as name uniqueness and impersonation prevention. One promising solution that offers a significant breakthrough in tackling this problem is the use of the Levenshtein distance.

## Name Generation & Blockchain

The idea is to have a system that is analogous to how domain names work for IP addresses on the internet. We call this the Blockchain Name Service (BNS). This service should be able to assign unique, human-readable names to blockchain addresses. However, these names must be discardable, meaning that an address owner should be able to request a new one if they do not like the assigned name. A deterministic yet non-reversible algorithm can help generate these consistent names.

## Challenges with Name Generation

The main challenge lies in generating a word list that can cover all possible blockchain addresses. The total number of unique Ethereum addresses, for example, is 2^160, which is approximately 1.46 x 10^48. Assigning a unique, human-readable name to each possible address requires an extraordinarily large word list and, therefore, isn't practically feasible. 

Another hurdle is name impersonation. It's essential that the generated names are not too similar to each other, preventing confusion or malicious impersonation. This brings us to the concept of Levenshtein distance.

## Levenshtein Distance for Name Generation

The Levenshtein distance, also known as the edit distance, is a measure of the difference between two strings. It is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other. 

In the context of blockchain name generation, applying a minimum Levenshtein distance requirement between any two names ensures that they differ by at least a certain number of character alterations. For example, if we apply a minimum edit distance of 3, the names "apple" and "apply" wouldn't be permitted as they require just one substitution. However, "apple" and "grape" would be acceptable as they require at least five substitutions.

Implementing this requirement could significantly reduce the number of available names, especially if the minimum edit distance is high or if the word list contains many similar words. It's important to note that entirely avoiding name impersonation might not be possible as human perception of similarity can extend beyond just the edit distance. However, using the Levenshtein distance as a measure provides a structured way to add a layer of security against potential name impersonation.

## Conclusion

The Levenshtein distance presents a compelling solution for the name generation process in blockchain technology, aiding in both uniqueness and the prevention of impersonation. However, it's essential to remember that user experience also matters. Having dissimilar or excessively long phrases may not be user-friendly and could result in its own set of problems. The key is to strike a balance between security, user experience, and feasibility, paving the way for more intuitive interactions within the blockchain ecosystem. 

As the blockchain community continues to grow and evolve, such innovative approaches to enhancing user experience will play a crucial role in increasing the technology's accessibility and adoption.
